# Machine Learning, Stanford

This repository contains the most recent versions of all projects and peer assessments for the [Machine Learning, Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Coursera course.

### 1. Introduction to Data Science in Python

### 2. [Linear Regression](Week2%20-%20Linear%20Regression/machine-learning-ex1)

Implement the multivariate linear regression on house pricing data and plot the contour of cost function.

### 3. [Logistic Regression](Week3%20-%20Logistic%20Regression/machine-learning-ex2)

Implement the logistic regression for quality assurance of microchips from a fabrication plant. The model is further improved using regularization techniques.

### 4. [Neural Networks: Representation](Week4%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20Representation/machine-learning-ex3)

Implement and compare multi-class logistic regression and neural network over hand-written MNIST dataset. Conclude the advantage of neural network by forming non-linear hypothesis.

### 5. [Neural Networks: Learning](Week5%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20Learning/machine-learning-ex4)

Implement the same neural network over MNIST dataset while digging the concept of backpropagation and effect of regularization.

### 6. [Applying Machine Learning](Week6%20-%20Applying%20Machine%20Learning/machine-learning-ex5)

Build model with different parameteric values and study the resulting bias-variance tradeoff.

### 7. [Support Vector Machines](Week7%20-%20Support%20Vector%20Machines/machine-learning-ex6)

Build model to get deep understanding of support vector machines b implementing it on spam email classification dataset.

### 8. [Unsupervised Learning](Week8%20-%20Unsupervised%20Learning/machine-learning-ex7)

Implement K-means algorithm for image compression by substituting the whole set of colors used in the image by set of color of K centroids. Also, implement the PCA on face dataset for the dimensionality reduction.

### 9. [Anomaly Detection](Week9%20-%20Anomaly%20Detection/machine-learning-ex8)

Implement the anomaly detection algorithm on server computers by fitting gaussian distribution over dataset. Also, implement the collaborative filtering learning algorithm on movie ratings dataset.
